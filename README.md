# adopt_dont_shop

## Team Name: 404 Brain not Found...

## Purpose

Our project is to create a site where new pet owners can search for a pet through the pet finder api and then pull information on the pet breed from wikipedia, allowing them to gain more knowledge on the breed before adopting the animal. 

## User Story
As a pet lover, I want to know more information on breeds before I adopt a new pet. Some people donâ€™t know anything about their adopted breed before jumping into owning a pet. Knowing this information can make or break keeping the pet.
Mission: increase adoption success
